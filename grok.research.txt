# grok.research - Beekeemon Research Recap (Initialized Feb 21, 2025)

**Research Focus**: Exploring beekeeping games to refine *Beekeemon*’s mechanics, art, and development process.

**History of Research**:
- **Feb 21, 2025**:  
  - **Scope**: Focused on troubleshooting and artwork pipeline.  
  - **Findings**: No external research yet, but identified need for pixel art tools (e.g., Photopea for resizing).  
- **Prior Context**: Hive dynamics inspired by sim games, but specifics from other titles pending.

**Beekeeping Games on Radar**:
- *APICO*: Breeding and conservation mechanics.  
- *Beekeeper*: Economic strategy focus.  
- *Hive Time*: Base-building elements.  
- **Research Gaps**: How do these games handle visuals, player engagement, and development challenges?

**Trajectory Aligned**: We’re aiming for a retro sim with deep hive mechanics and crisp pixel art, distinct from idle or economic games. Next, we’ll research these titles to refine our approach and solve image scaling issues.
